# Effect-of-the-Number-of-Technologies-on-Market-Concentration
The following assignment script is part of the coursework completed in the lecture "Computational Economics $II$" at TU Chemnitz, presented by Prof. Dr. Heinrich. Comments within the script acknowledge the course context, and where applicable, specify instances where the code is developed based on provided course materials.

## Experiment Overview
In this experiment, we aim to explore the impact of the number of possible technologies on market concentration within a population with a network structure. The model is based on Brian Arthur's technology choice model, implemented in an agent-based framework with an Erdos-Renyi network structure (p = 0.1). We will analyze the resulting market concentration by varying the number of available technologies.

## Interpretation
- Longer simulation leads to equilibrium, increased market concentration, and higher variability.
- Highlights the influence of simulation duration on market dynamics.

**Note:** Results interpretation based on specific simulation setup and assumptions. Further analysis recommended for deeper insights.
